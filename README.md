# Terminal image viewer
![](demo.gif)
A program to view images in the terminal using ANSI escape codes<br>
Definitely not practical, done mostly because I thought it would be funny<br>
<br>
Uses [stbi_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) to load images<br>
Probably doesn't work that well with terminals that dont handle ansi escape codes well but whatever. This was tested with [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and xterm so I know those work lmao<br>
<br>
Hopefully I will add things like gif and/or video playback eventually but I doubt I'll get that working<br>
